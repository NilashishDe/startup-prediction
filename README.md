It looks like you're running into some common environment and installation issues on Windows. Let's get those sorted out.

Here are the updated instructions to fix the errors and run the application.

### Corrected `README.md`

# Startup Success Prediction

This project is a web application that predicts the success of a startup based on various features. It uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of startup information. The web application is built with **Flask** and allows users to input startup data and get a prediction on its success probability.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.10+**
  * **pip** (Python package installer)
  * **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nilashishde/startup-prediction.git
    cd startup-prediction
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

      * Open **PowerShell as an Administrator**.
      * Navigate to the project directory.
      * Run the following commands:
        ```powershell
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

    > **Note:** If you get an error about running scripts being disabled, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process` and then try activating again.

3.  **Upgrade pip and install requirements:**

    ```bash
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the web application, execute the following command in the project's root directory (with the virtual environment activated):

```bash
python -m flask run
```

The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open this URL in your web browser to use the application.

### Why the changes?

  * **Administrator Privileges:** The `OSError` with `.deleteme` often points to a permissions issue. Running PowerShell as an administrator can resolve this.
  * **`python -m flask run`:** Using this command instead of just `flask run` is a more robust way to run your app. It directly uses the Python interpreter from your activated virtual environment, ensuring that the correct packages are found and used. This bypasses issues where `flask` might not be in your system's PATH.
